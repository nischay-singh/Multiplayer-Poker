# Multiplayer Poker

The final website can be viewed at - https://multiplayer-poker.onrender.com/

Welcome to Poker Night - an online poker website where you and your friends can play, without the risk of entering any payment information. I felt the need to create this website because my friends and I spent many hours looking for a way to play online without entering our credit card information. At Poker Night, one can simply create a lobby, share the game code and play classic Texas Hold'em poker. 

## Instructions to install to your local machine

Make sure to have the latest release of Node.js and Node Packaage Manager (npm) installed before attempting to run this project. Once in the desired directory, run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/nischay-singh/Blog-Dashboard.git
npm install
cd client
npm install
```

Then, run the following command in the api folder-
```
nodemon app.js
```

Finally, run the following command in the client folder-
```
npm run dev
```

However, while running the application locally, you will not be able to play with other computers. To test, you can create a new window and join the lobby as the second player.
